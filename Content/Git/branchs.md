# Branches
    
Branches enable us to work on multiple ideas in parallel. If we make changes on one branch, they do not effect the other branches (unless we merge the branches).

In git we are always working on a branch, the default one is `master` .

### Head
    
  Head is a pointer that refers to the current branch in your repo.
    
- `git branch` - List all existing branches. The branch that has a `*` in front of it is the branch we are currently on.
- `git branch branch-name` - Create a new branch, based upon the current HEAD . It does not switch to the branch.
- `git switch branch-name` - Switch to a different branch. There is an older command which is `git checkout branch-name`
- `git switch -c branch-name` - Creates a new branch and switches to it.
- `git branch -d branch name` - Deletes the specified branch, you canâ€™t delete a branch if youâ€™re in it.
- `git branch -m new-name` - Renames the branch, you have to be on the the branch to rename it.

##### Switching Branches With Unstaged Changes
    
    ðŸ’¡ When you have unstage changes they will come with you to the branches you switch to, if you have uncommitted changes git will yell at you.
